# Installing and Running FS-UAE Launcher

## Requirements for Ubuntu or Debian

The following packages are needed:

    sudo apt install python3 python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtopengl \
        python3-requests

At this point, PyOpenGL is bundled, but in the future you might also need
to manually install:

    sudo apt install python3-opengl

To add support for .lha archives, you also need to have the lhafile
python package installed. You can get python3-lhafile from Frode's PPA,
or you can install with pip: `pip3 install lhafile`.

You can run the launcher directly from the source directory:

    ./fs-uae-launcher

In this case you should have a matching fs-uae source directory in
../fs-uae, and successully compiled fs-uae with "make" (no installation
needed). FS-UAE Launcher will then find the fs-uae and fs-uae-device-helper
binaries from this parallel source directory.

## Installing

To install to /usr/local, you can run:

    ./bootstrap
    sudo make install

Remember to also install FS-UAE itself.
